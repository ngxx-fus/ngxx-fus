# What I'm looking for

Goal: ``` Peace â€“ Togetherness â€“ Commitment ``` 

## Peace & Togetherness

I love both sunrise and sunshine, but the feeling under the sunshine is often different. I feel empty, like Iâ€™ve lost something precious. I just want a long hug when the sunlight is fading â€” or a ride around the city, grabbing some food or drinks. Iâ€™ll tell you about my day and listen to yours. Andâ€¦ Iâ€™m a boy â€” the one who stands behind you, cheering you on.

A relationship should be an exchange of love â€” when you give, you should also receive. We should be equals; I can compromise for you sometimes, but that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™ll always put you above myself. I want to be loved, too.

## Commitment

**The standard** is simple â€” just **two people**, **on time**. :>

- S1. It starts with liking someone â€” maybe their face, their voice, their texting style, or little things like that. During this stage, I might be a bit annoying. 
- S2. If you can accept my annoying side, Iâ€™ll start wanting to know the person inside you â€” your your views on life, your thoughts about love. At the same time, Iâ€™ll show you the real face of myself.
- S3. If we make it through Stage 2 without any unexpected problems that break the connection, then maybeâ€¦ weâ€™ll become each otherâ€™s lover â€” known to everyone (well, except my parents ðŸ˜…).

(Relationship philosophy)

# What Iâ€™ve had / Planning to have

- Iâ€™m one of those dreamers â€” someone who patiently chases what (or who) I love, driven by a dream that borrows hope from the future to keep moving forward.
- If self-rating is possible, Iâ€™d say I have a lot of positive energy during the day â€” but not so much at night. :>
- I can take you around the city until youâ€™re tired or fall asleep. I want a relationship long enough to live together â€” to hug and kiss you every day.
- I have a short memory, so I never stay angry for long â€” easy to upset, easy to smile again.
- I can cook a little â€” maybe enough to help you when youâ€™re sick or feeling low-energy.
- Iâ€™m also an amateur photographer. Iâ€™d love to take photos of you â€” the most beautiful version of you I can capture.
- In the future, I want to learn proper cooking and baking in a more professional way.

No worries â€” if youâ€™re an exception, then all those words above are just decorations, right? :>
Iâ€™ll take the initiative to get to know you, but I do hope for a little response in return. :3
Iâ€™m easy to get along with â€” as long as we click, the rest doesnâ€™t really matter. :3
